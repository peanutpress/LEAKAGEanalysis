Image-J-Matlab: 2-photon imaging leakage analysis
The following program was built using the ImageJ-MATLAB plugin which allows information transfer between the two environments. You will be able open, view and save FIJI images in matlab. The matching/masking apps require the images to be saved as matrices in the workspace. This is achieved by the IJM Java function. The following documentation is aimed at familiarising the user with the data analysis steps. You will be able to use FIJI to extract your own dataset, or alternaltively, quickly run through an example set to familiarise yourself with the process.
